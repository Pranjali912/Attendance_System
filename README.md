# Attendance_System

<h3><b>This is a face recognition attendance system. I made this project for Microsoft Intern Engage 2022 Mentorship program.</b></h3>

<br>
I made this project using Python.I used OpenCV and Tkinter.
<br>
I used MySql for database.
<br>
To run this project one must have python,C++ development tools,opencv-python,face_recognition,tkinter,numpy.

<br>
Firstly ,we need to enter the credentials like Name,Id,Roll number,Department,Course etc..
<br>
Then ,upload some sample images through webcam.
<br>
Train those images.
<br>
Use face dectector to detect a face and it will automatically mark the attendance.
<br>
A .csv will be generated that will show the attendance.
